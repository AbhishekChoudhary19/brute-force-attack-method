# brute-force-attack-method
A brute force attack is uses a trial-and-error approach to systematically guess login info, credentials, and encryption keys. 
Brute-force attacks work by calculating every possible combination that could make up a password and testing it to see if it is the correct password. As the password's length increases, the amount of time, on average, to find the correct password increases exponentially.

Kindly note:
ðŸ¦¯ calculating every possible combination isn't perfect,generation of numerical probability is perfect.
